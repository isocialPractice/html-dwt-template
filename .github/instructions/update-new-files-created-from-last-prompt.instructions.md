# Update New Files Created from Last Prompt

import repeating-edit-file-rules

## Overview

Add light, on-brand filler content to the files created during the last prompt run. Tailor the copy to each filename so it feels contextually appropriate. Aim for material that is one or two steps above generic `lorem ipsum` while still reading like placeholder text.

## Rules for Updating Site Files

Use cliche statements that nod to the page topic, but keep them broad enough that future updates can replace them without conflict.

### Prompt Requirements

None.

## Additional Notes

- Keep tone and terminology aligned with the wider project so each page feels cohesive.
- Favor short sections, bulleted lists, or simple CTAs that match the layout already in place.
- Leave room for future contributors to swap in final content without restructuring the page.

## Variables

openPrompt = "UPDATE NEW FILES FROM LAST PROMPT"
